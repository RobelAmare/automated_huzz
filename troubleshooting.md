## Troubleshooting

*   If the workflow fails to run, check the GitHub Actions logs for any errors in the **destination repository**.
*   Make sure that the `release.yml` file is correctly placed in the `.github/workflows` directory in the **destination repository**.
*   Ensure that the `GITHUB_TOKEN` secret is enabled for the **destination repository**.
*   Double-check that the `SOURCE_REPO_TOKEN` secret is correctly configured with a PAT that has `repo` scope in the **source repository**.
*   Double-check that the repository and folder paths are correctly specified in the `FILES=$(ls source_repo/"path/to/your/python/folder"/*.py)` line.
